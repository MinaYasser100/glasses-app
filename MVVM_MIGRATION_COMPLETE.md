# 🎉 MVVM Migration Completed Successfully! 

## What We Accomplished

### ✅ **Complete MVVM Architecture Implementation**
Your Flutter Glasses App has been successfully refactored from a basic structure to a professional **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture using Flutter Bloc/Cubit for state management.

### 🏗️ **New Project Structure**
